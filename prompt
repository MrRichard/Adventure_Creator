TODO:
- Implement an internal Dice Rolling feature
- Refactor to create hierarchy processing
  1. Identify locations and create fictional top level short descriptions from the map
  2. For each region, ROLL (1d6) for the number of locations and characters to create. Store this result temporarily.
  3. Total the number of locations and number of characters per region. Multiply by 3. Add the number of regions.
  4. Ask the user if they want to make this many GPT queries. Wait for their response. 
  5. For each region, generate several locations and characters (random 1d6 for each category)
  6. For each location
    - Generate an isometric map image using DALL-E
    - Create a description of the location
    - Roll 1d10 for "hidden feature". The higher the number, the more rare or special secret features exist at this location. Lower numbers are very mundane.
    - Store map image in /images folder
    - Save the path in the world JSON file associated with the location
  7. For each character
    - Generate a portrait image using DALL-E
    - Create a physical description of the character
    - Create a personality or short biography of the person
    - Store the portrait in the /images folder
    - Save the path in the world JSON file associated with the character
  8. Give the whole JSON file to GPT4 for review
    - Suggest 6 plotlines that span across one or several regions.
    - Suggest 2 grand narrative quests
  9. Compile into a collection of markdown files
    - Opening world description and context window
    - A document for each region that includes 1 main photo, a base description
      - All locations and their respective photos
      - All characters and their portraits and backstory
      - A collection of the suggested quests
