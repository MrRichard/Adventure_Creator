The Ariel Coast
- Civilized Fantasy world, with flairs of Edwardian England. 
- Cities like Highton, Cloudfire, Voldrash, Starmyst are the major powers in the region. They are all allies, but competition for resources is fierce.
- Small towns like Freecot, Emerald Chapel, Daggerbrook, and New Pass often live in the shadow of the major cities. Sometimes exploited by their neighbors, and in other cases, they are the suburbs for the normal people of the city. 
- The Sea and the Copperridge mountains are major barriers in the area. The mountains have many dangers in them. This keeps most trade occuring through the ports. 
- Little is known about the land beyond the mountains. Rumors of orcish warbands, tribal warfare, slavery and constant fear of death. In general, a harder way of life for the humans that are native there. 
- This land was once ruled by another culture. Few ruins remain, but the Crypt of the Silent King is one place few people dare to go.
- There are many rumors about the tower of illusions, but no one actually knows the truth.
- Each large city has it's own government, but they are all some form of monarchy. All rulers are dukes or baronies, vassels of the great king in the North (off map)

The peoples who live here
- Humans occupy most of the cities and tend to have an 18th century flair about their identites
- Dwarves in this world tend to live near mountains but not in mountains. They are similar to 17th century Scottish highlanders mixed with some finnish lore
- Elves are extremely rare. Some half-elven characters may leave the woods to trade in cities, but in general they are only met in passing on the road. They are general druidic religious zealots who explore all kind's relationship to nature. They are magical, but also very emotionally in touch.
- Tieflings in this world are very similar to humans. They tend to be more like Gypsies or the Kale / Roma / Travellers.

Visal Style
- The visual style and feel of this adventure is "Dark Low Fantasy". Other races exist, but real magic is hidden and difficult to come by. The visual style is generally a darker, grittier, pen and ink illustration. Heavy on details, but sometimes excluding or leaving unnessary details incomplete.
