The Ariel Coast: 
Civilized Fantasy world. Heavily influenced by the Pathfinder world, Golarion. Cities like Highton, Cloudfire, Voldrash, Starmyst are the major powers in the region. They are all allies, but competition for resources is fierce. Small towns like Freecot, Emerald Chapel, Daggerbrook, and New Pass often live in the shadow of the major cities. Sometimes exploited by their neighbors, and in other cases, they are the suburbs for the normal people of the city. The Sea and the Copperridge mountains are major barriers in the area. The mountains have many dangers in them. This keeps most trade occuring through the ports. Little is known about the land beyond the mountains. Rumors of orcish warbands, tribal warfare, slavery and constant fear of death. In general, a harder way of life for the humans that are native there. This land was once ruled by another culture. Few ruins remain, but the Crypt of the Silent King is one place few people dare to go. There are many rumors about the tower of illusions, but no one actually knows the truth. Each large city has it's own government, but they are all some form of monarchy. All rulers are dukes or baronies, vassels of the great king in the North (off map)

The peoples who live here: 
- Humans occupy most of the cities and tend to have an 18th century flair about their identites. 
- Dwarves in this world tend to live near mountains but not in mountains. Dwarves are similar to 17th century Scottish highlanders mixed with some finnish lore. 
- Elves are extremely rare. Some half-elven characters may leave the woods to trade in cities. Half-elves and elves are only met in passing on the road. Elven kin are general druidic religious zealots who explore all kind's relationship to nature. They are magical, but also very emotionally in touch. Tieflings in this world are very similar to humans. 
- Tieflings tend to be more like Gypsies or the Kale / Roma / Travellers. They are romantics and illusionists, free souls connected to divine spirits.
- Few child characters. Children and mothers present in the world, but do not talk to strangers. Most stories will not involve child characters. 
The visual style and feel of this adventure is "High Fantasy". Illustrations should be bright and colorful. While cities and civilized life is pretty, there is still danger outside of the city walls.
