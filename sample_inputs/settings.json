    "visual_style" : "The visual style of all artwork should look vary city to city. All artwork should look like light pencil contour drawings with water color paints for color. The illustrations have high attention to detail. All content should be safe for work. IMPORTANT: Do not draw any text or wording.", 
    "writing_style" : "All descriptions should be well written and creative within the confines of the context. The writing style should be written from a first person's perspective re-telling a tale of recent exploration. Similar to travel journal from the 18th century England. All written content should be safe-for-work.",
    "cover_style" : "The visual style of the cover artwork should be similar to classic Dungeons and Dragons artwork. A fantasy border surrounding a full-color painted scene of some action or adventure involving adventurers, a fantasy location, and a great monster or beast. All content should be safe for work. IMPORTANT: Do not draw any text. No pencils or pens used as evidence of the medium. Only the cover image in glorius full color."
