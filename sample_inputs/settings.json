    "visual_style" : "The visual style of all artwork should look vary city to city: Northern cities and towns closer to the mountains have a darker, grittier appearance. Life is harder in the mountains with snow and stone being a major motif. Southern and coastal cities and towns have a cleaner, light and airy look to them. Life is opulent here with ships and the beauty being the major motif. All artwork should look like light pencil contour drawings with water color paints for color. The illustrations have high attention to detail. While risque content maybe included, all content should be safe for work. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text.", 
    "writing_style" : "All descriptions should be well written and creative within the confines of the context. The writing style should be written from a first person's perspective re-telling a tale of recent exploration. Similar to travel journal from the 18th century England. All written content should be safe-for-work.",
    "cover_style" : "The visual style of the cover artwork should be similar to classic Dungeons and Dragons artwork. A fantasy border surrounding a full-color painted scene of some action or adventure involving adventurers, a fantasy location, and a great monster or beast. While risque content maybe included, all content should be safe for work. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text."
