Lone Tree Crossing refers to a fantasy western setting. The timeframe is early in the American "Old West" or Frontier period.
The year is approximately 1820 A.D. and Lone Tree Crossing is a largely barren stretch of land that sits between the disputed
borders of three different regions: The largely unorganzied Oregon Country, The early United States Missouri territories, and 
the northern portion of New Spain.

This setting is rural, tough, and dramatic. Trade keeps unlikely characters bound together in Lone Tree Crossing. While the law 
is set by Missouri territories marshalls, rules are flexible and only money and blood solve some problems. 

The landscape is dry and mountinous with areas of lush farmland owned by wealth landowners. They employ poor workers and hire 
brutal taskmasters to motivate labor. Hired guns defend the land from rival gangs, bandits, and overzealous law enforcement.
